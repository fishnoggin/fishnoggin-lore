		The Red Hunt is an organization founded on the fear of a prophecy - a cataclysmic event that they believe will exceed the destruction of the <a href="planesrift.histore.culling.html">Culling</a>.<br>
		They constantly amass strength and practice obsessive self-discipline in order to survive its passing.

		The Red Hunt have been conferred the status of a religious organizatinon by the <a href="planesrift.organizations.faiths_council.html">Council of Faiths</a>, and as such are allowed land in the Church District and the rights that accompany it. They reside in a manor in Lower Planesrift.

	<p>
		The primary prophesy of the Red Hunt concerns an event they refer to as "The Night of Last Hunt." They believe that on this day, a godlike entity will emerge from behind the moon and lay waste to the poulation of the near planes, leaving only one in seven alive. The Red Hunt seek solely to strengthen themselves so that they may be a part of that surviving seventh.
	</p>
	<p>
		The prophesy is translated roughly into modern common below:
	</p>
	<blockquote><p>
		"lol my guy <br>
		i haven't [translated-written] that yet <br>
		poetry is not my primary [concern-task] <br>
		at this moment"
	</p></blockquote>
	<p>
		The Red Hunt do not dictate to their allegiants how they must pursue their goals, but generally encourage self-discipline and rigorous training.
	</p>
	<p>
		Though the Red Hunt retains the right of sanctuary as a religious organization, they make a point of never using it. If any of their allegiants are sought for crimes commited, it is considered the responsibility of the individual to overcome the situation.
