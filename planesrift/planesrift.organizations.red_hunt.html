		The Red Hunt is an organization founded on the fear of a prophecy - a cataclysmic event that they believe will exceed the destruction of the <a href="planesrift.histore.culling.html">Culling</a>.<br>
		They constantly amass strength and practice obsessive self-discipline in order to survive its passing.

		The primary prophesy of the Red Hunt concerns an event they refer to as "The Night of Last Hunt." They believe that on this day, a godlike entity will emerge from behind the moon and lay waste to the poulation of the near planes, leaving only one in seven alive. The Red Hunt seek to strengthen themselves so that they may be a part of that surviving seventh.
	</p>
	<p>
		The prophesy is translated roughly into common below:
	</p>
	<blockquote><p>
		"lol my guy <br>
		i haven't [translated-written] that yet <br>
		poetry is not my primary [concern-task]"
	</p></blockquote>
