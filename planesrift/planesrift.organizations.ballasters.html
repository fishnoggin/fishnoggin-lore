		Most sky-faring vessels operating around Planesrift require shiphands with minor arcane ability to maintain and operate their magical machinery. The original members of the Ballasters were indentured servants on such a vessel, staging a mutiny that blossomed into Planesrift’s newest <strike>criminal empire</strike> workers' union.<br>

		<h3> <img src="../images/search_icon.png" class="bulletpoint">Ideals</h3>
		<p>
			The Ballasters exist to intimidate those that would exploit the lower class of Planesrift, rapidly escalating to force whenever they deem necessary.
		</p>
		<p>
			Members are fiercely loyal to their group and cause, ousting any traitors, or "scabs," usually in violent and public fashion.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ballasters spurn the law and maintain a special rivalry with the Justiciar’s men, often taking their distinctive blue coats and wearing them as trophies of victory.
		</p>


		<h3> <img src="../images/search_icon.png" class="bulletpoint">Operations</h3>
		<p>
			The gang employs many sorcerers in its ranks, often pressing them into service, as well as wizards, artificers, and others. They practice the full range of magic, but hold a special esteem for evocation. Combined with an intentional provocation of Planesrift’s unstable atmosphere, the Ballasters’ shock-and-awe tactics leave little room for subtlety.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Ballasters regularly conduct raids on groups and estates that they take particular issue with; exploitative businesses, slavers, rival gangs, scabs, lawmen, and similar.

			<h4><img src="../images/search_icon.png" class="bulletpoint"><a href="planesrift.organizations.red_hunt.html">The Red Hunt</a></h4>
			<p>
				The Ballasters and the Red Hunt maintain an oil-and-water relationship. In particular, the Ballasters, an organization built on camaraderie, take issue with the the Red Hunt's willingness to abandon those that they consider weak. Additionally, they consider the Hunt's leadership to be complacent "old money," throwing their weight around to live in comfort and maintain the status quo.

	</h3>
	<blockquote>
		<h4 class="hidden azmira eve"><img src="../images/search_icon.png" class="bulletpoint">Captain Brything</h4>
		<p class="hidden eve azmira">
			Nearly as much a mythical figure as a man, Captain James Brything has served as the revered leader of the Ballasters for most of their lifespan. Though he once insisted on leading from the front, pressure from law enforcement now forces him to live as a recluse. Despite the constant chaos of the organization, he is known for always having a plan.
		</p>
		<p class="hidden eve">
			<b>Eve:</b> You have met Captain Brything only a handful of times: once when he led the raid that freed you and a scant few others to negotiate the terms of your employment. He seems to genuinely have the best interests of the public at heart, even if his means are not always immaculate.
		</p>
		<p class="hidden azmira">
			<b>Azmira:</b> As a child, you remember a young James Brything visiting your house to meet with your parents. You were too young to remember what they discussed, but you remember him treating you kindly.<br>
			Later, you recognize him on wanted posters that advertise him to be the now-leader of the organization you hold accountable for your parents' death.
