		Most sky-faring vessels operating around Planesrift require shiphands with minor arcane ability to maintain and operate their magical machinery. The original members of the Ballasters were indentured servants on such a vessel, staging a mutiny that blossomed into Planesrift’s newest <strike>criminal empire</strike> workers' union.<br>

			The gang employs many sorcerers in its ranks, often pressing them into service, as well as wizards, artificers, and others. They practice the full range of magic, but hold a special esteem for evocation. Combined with an intentional provocation of Planesrift’s unstable atmosphere, the Ballasters’ shock-and-awe tactics leave little room for subtlety.<br>
			Ballasters spurn the law and maintain a special rivalry with the Justiciar’s men, often taking their distinctive blue coats and wearing them as trophies of victory.

			<p>
				The Ballasters and the Red Hunt maintain an oil-and-water relationship. In particular, the Ballasters, an organization built on camaraderie, take issue with the the Red Hunt's willingness to abandon those that they consider weak. Additionally, they consider the Hunt's leadership to be complacent "old money," throwing their weight around to live in comfort and maintain the status quo.
