        The current Archhunter of the Red Hunt, Emíl Gestalt has marked a recent shift in the organization's direction. A changeling himself, Gestalt has opened the group slightly as a refuge to those nonhumans rejected by the Chapel. This supposes, however, that the individuals in question are able to <i>survive</i> life in the Hunt, which is rarely the case.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like many other changlings in Planesrift, Gestalt came into the city as an illegal slave and, like many others, is missing two fingers on his right hand - the comparatively lenient punishment in the city for a slave killing their master.
    </p>
    <p>
        Though his skin is disfigured in many places and his breathing constantly labored, the Archhunter's office is one earned by violence - an office that is sufficient proof in itself of the unpredictable danger he may pose to outsiders.

        <h4>Azmira:</h4>
        <p>
            Emíl had a close relationshp with <a href="planesrift.npcs.katja.html">Katja</a> until her death, protective and bordering on smothering. This likely sprung from their similar experiences as changelings.<br>
            He also seemed to be of the opinion that she should be harsher on you, and insisted on pushing you even further in your training after she died.
