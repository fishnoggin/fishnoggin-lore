	<h2>Obliviant of Mirthark</h2>

	<p><i>
		By chance or fate, you have managed to become an adherent to the ways of Mirthark, God of the Obscure. Largely left to your own devices, you are tasked with keeping dangerous information safely away from those it might harm.<br>
		You might follow him in the interest of the greater good, for the privilege of accessing the information he guards, or simply because you enjoy living your life as a ghost.

		<h4><i>Choose one feature from the following. Additional features may be granted later as boons.</i></h4>

		<h3>Blanket of Ignorance:</h3>
		<p>
			In your service of Mirthark, you’ve discovered that some things are better left unknown, leaning on the God of Obscurity to suppress your curiosity towards dangers that would otherwise draw your attention. <br>
			When you are forced to make a Wisdom saving throw against an effect caused by something you can see or hear, you may use your reaction to give yourself advantage on the roll. You may use this feature twice and regain all uses of it when you complete a long rest.
		</p>

		<h3>Expanded Spell List:</h3>
		<p>
			As you gain levels, you are granted access to additional spells on your spell list(s). The spells are always prepared and do not count against your number of spells known.
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Level:</th>
					<th>Spells:</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1st</td>
					<td><i>Encode Thoughts, Protection from Evil and Good</i></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>3rd</td>
					<td><i>Nystul’s Magic Aura, Pass Without Trace</i></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>5th</td>
					<td><i>Intellect Fortress, Nondetection</i></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>7th</td>
					<td><i>Death Ward, Mordenkainen’s Private Sanctum</i></td>
				</tr><tr>
					<td>9th</td>
					<td><i>Mislead, Modify Memory</i></td>
				</tr>
			</table>

		<h3>Wanderer's Shroud</h3>
			<p>
				The influence of Mirthark has made it difficult for even Death to find you. For every two years that pass, you age only one.  <br>
				When you roll a death saving throw, you may add your Charisma (Stealth) modifier to the roll. Additionally, you treat a d20 roll of 18 or higher as a 20 when making a death saving throw.
