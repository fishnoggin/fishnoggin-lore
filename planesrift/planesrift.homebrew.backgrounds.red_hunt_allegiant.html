	<h2>Red Hunt Allegiant</h2>

	<p><i>
		You’ve chosen to throw your lot in with the Red Hunt, an esoteric organization dedicated to the pursuit of self-discipline and indomitable power. You might spend your time poring over ancient texts to divine the future, working as a blade-for-hire to hone your skills, or cutting your own way through Planesrift’s nighttime streets.<br>
		Regardless of how deeply you subscribe to the gang’s beliefs, the operations of the entire organization are underlined by a singular fear: the Night of Last Hunt is coming, and you must be strong enough to come out on top when it does.<br>
		Members of the Red Hunt are commonly rangers, warlocks, rogues, fighters, and occasionally evil-aligned paladins or clerics. As a whole, the organization trends Lawful Evil.<br>

	<blockquote>
		<h3>Hunter's Sight:</h3>
		<p>
			You learn your choice of either the <i>Hex</i> or <i>Hunter’s Mark</i> spells and may cast that spell once at 1st level without spending a spell slot or using material components. You regain the ability to cast the spell in this way after you complete a long rest. While you have another creature under the effect of a spell cast using this feature, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, the range instead increases by 60 feet.
