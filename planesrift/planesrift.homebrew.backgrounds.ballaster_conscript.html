	<h2>Ballaster Conscript</h2>

	<p><i>
		You are a member of Planesrift’s newest <strike>criminal enterprise</strike> workers’ union. You might have turned to their employ after spending years as an exploited shiphand or overworked enchanter, been “recruited” after having your sorcerous talent noticed by one of their members, or joined as a tinkerer looking to make a name for yourself and your work.<br>
		Ballasters are typically sorcerers, artificers, wizards, rogues, or fighters, but all are welcome in their ranks. As a whole, the organization trends Chaotic Neutral.

	<blockquote>
		<h3>Firearm Proficiency:</h3>
		<p>
			Since their inception, the Ballasters have made eager use of firearms imported from the Black Coast to the east. You have proficiency with firearms.
		</p>

		<h3>Arcane Improvist:</h3>
		<p>
			Your time amongst the wild ranks of the Ballasters has taught you semi-flexible magical talents.<br>
			You learn a cantrip and a 1st-level spell of your choice from either the Sorcerer or Wizard spell list. Both spells must be from the same list.<br>
			You can cast the chosen 1st-level spell without a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have.<br>
			Your spellcasting ability for these spells is Charisma if you chose from the Sorcerer list, and Intelligence if you chose from the Wizard list.<br>
			You may change one of the spells for another on the same list when you gain a new level.
